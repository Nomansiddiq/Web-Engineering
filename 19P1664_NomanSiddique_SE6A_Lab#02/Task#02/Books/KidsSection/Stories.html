<li><h2><B><U>The Boy Who Cried Wolf</B></U></h2></li>
<p>Once, there was a boy who became bored when he watched over the village sheep grazing on the hillside. To entertain himself, <br>
he sang out, “Wolf! Wolf! The wolf is chasing the sheep!” When the villagers heard the cry, they came running up the hill to drive<br>
the wolf away. But, when they arrived, they saw no wolf. The boy was amused when seeing their angry faces.<br>
<br>
“Don’t scream wolf, boy,” warned the villagers, “when there is no wolf!” They angrily went back down the hill.<br>
<br>
Later, the shepherd boy cried out once again, “Wolf! Wolf! The wolf is chasing the sheep!” To his amusement, he looked on as the villagers<br>
 came running up the hill to scare the wolf away.<br>
<br>
As they saw there was no wolf, they said strictly, “Save your frightened cry for when there really is a wolf! Don’t cry ‘wolf’ when there is<br>
no wolf!” But the boy grinned at their words while they walked grumbling down the hill once more.<br>
<br>
Later, the boy saw a real wolf sneaking around his flock. Alarmed, he jumped on his feet and cried out as loud as he could, “Wolf! Wolf!” But the<br>
 villagers thought he was fooling them again, and so they didn’t come to help.<br>
<br>
At sunset, the villagers went looking for the boy who hadn’t returned with their sheep. When they went up the hill, they found him weeping.<br>
<br>
“There really was a wolf here! The flock is gone! I cried out, ‘Wolf!’ but you didn’t come,” he wailed.<br>
<br>
An old man went to comfort the boy. As he put his arm around him, he said, “Nobody believes a liar, even when he is telling the truth!”<br>

<li><h2><B><U>The Golden Touch</U></B></h2></li>

<p>There once was a king named Midas who did a good deed for a Satyr. And he was then granted a wish by Dionysus, the god of wine.<br>
<br>
For his wish, Midas asked that whatever he touched would turn to gold. Despite Dionysus’ efforts to prevent it, Midas pleaded that <br>
this was a fantastic wish, and so, it was bestowed.<br>
<br>
Excited about his newly-earned powers, Midas started touching all kinds of things, turning each item into pure gold.<br>
<br>
But soon, Midas became hungry. As he picked up a piece of food, he found he couldn’t eat it. It had turned to gold in his hand.<br>
<br>
Hungry, Midas groaned, “I’ll starve! Perhaps this was not such an excellent wish after all!”<br>
<br>
Seeing his dismay, Midas’ beloved daughter threw her arms around him to comfort him, and she, too, turned to gold. “The golden touch is no blessing,” Midas cried.<br></p>
