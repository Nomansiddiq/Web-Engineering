<li><B><U>Project Hail Mary</U></B></li>
<p><h3>Andy Weir</h3>

An important memo to all fans of Andy Weir’s debut novel The Martian<br>
(and the Hollywood adaptation): read Project Hail Mary. Now.<br>
<br>
While the premise of the new story sounds near identical to the author’s <br>
earlier work – a lone man is forced to use his scientific cunning after he becomes<br>
stranded from Earth – the introduction of a mystery lifeforce, which we won’t spoil <br>
here, blasts the plot in an unexpected direction.<br>
<br>
Significantly, the protagonist is no Mark Watney, the astronaut played by Matt Damon <br>
in The Martian movie, either. The main character is, well, he doesn’t know what he is, <br>
waking from a coma next to two corpses, his memory banks empty. And if that’s not enough to<br>
draw you in, we don’t know what will.</p>

<li><B><U>Foodology: A Food-lover’s Guide to Digestive Health and Happiness</U></B></li>
<p><h3>Saliha Mahmood Ahmed</h3>
Foodology is part recipe book, part science book, all food. Gastroenterologist and food <br>
writer Saliha Mahmood Ahmed takes us on a tour of the digestive system, from the very first<br>
bite to… the other end. On the way, she also dives into why food makes us so happy and how a<br>
delicious smell can make our mouths water.<br>
<br>
On top of all of this, of course, are 50 recipes designed not just to be delicious, but to support your gut health.<br>

<li><B><U>Always On: Hope and Fear in the Social Smartphone Era</U></B></li>
<p><h3>Rory Cellan-Jones</h3>

Wake up. Check social media. Send a ‘good morning’ text. Check the weather app. Check the news… <BR>
From the moment our alarm apps go off in the morning to when we finally log off Instagram at night,<br>
 our smartphones are always by our sides.<br>
<br>
On the one hand, we can connect with more people than ever before and we have unlimited access to <br>
information. But on the other, these devices are encroaching on every aspect of our lives, giving tech<br>
 companies more access to and more control over everything about us.<br>
 <br>

Either way, the smartphone has arguably changed our lives more than almost any tool ever invented. <br>
In Always On, Rory Cellan-Jones, the BBC’s chief technology correspondent, explores whether this is cause for hope or fear.<br>
