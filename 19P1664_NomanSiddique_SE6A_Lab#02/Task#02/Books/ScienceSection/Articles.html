<li><B><U>“Biological Mask” Administered With a Nasal Spray Can Protect Against COVID-19</B></U></li>

<p><em><B>A molecule developed by researchers at the University of Helsinki can inactivate <br>the coronavirus spike protein and offers effective short-term protection against the virus.</B></em>
<br>
Cell cultures and animal studies show that TriSb92, a new molecule developed by the <br>
researchers, protects against coronavirus infection for at least eight hours even in <br>
cases of high exposure risk. In contrast to vaccine protection, the effect of TriSb92<br>
 begins immediately after its administration.<br>
<br>
“In animal models, nasally administered TriSb92 offered protection against infection in<br>
 an exposure situation where all unprotected mice were infected,” says Postdoctoral <br>Researcher Anna Mäkelä, the first author of the study.<br>
 <br>
 
 
 <h2><B><U>Targeting the Achilles heel of the coronavirus</U></B></h2>
The TriSb92 molecule is based on an entirely new technical solution developed in Finland<br>
 for targeting biological drugs. In the study carried out at the University of Helsinki,<br>
 this solution was utilized to inhibit the functioning of the spike protein on the surface<br> 
 of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.<br>
 <br>

“Targeting this inhibitory effect of the TriSb92 molecule to a site of the coronavirus spike <br>
protein common to all variants of the virus makes it possible to effectively inhibit the ability<br>
 of all known variants, Omicron included, to infect people,” Mäkelä explains.<br>
 <br>

In model virus studies, TriSb92 was able to prevent even the spread of SARS, the virus that <br>
threatened us in the early 2000s.<br>

“In other words, we can fairly confidently assume that future variants of SARS-CoV-2 and perhaps<br>
 even entirely new coronaviruses that may threaten to cause pandemics are susceptible to it,” Mäkelä confirms.<br>
<br>
The product, which is nasally administered, could in the future serve as a kind of biological <br>
protection against coronavirus infection that is sprayed on the mucous membranes.<br>


<h2><B><U>Vaccines still needed</U></B></h2>

Mäkelä works in Professor Kalle Saksela’s laboratory at the University of Helsinki. <br>
Saksela is involved in the development of a Finnish nasally administered coronavirus<br>
vaccine, which is expected to progress to clinical trials in the spring. Mäkelä and <br>
Saksela emphasize that, instead of competing with them, TriSb92 is a solution that <br>
supplements vaccines.<br>
<br>
“These types of molecules that prevent infections, or antiviral drugs for that matter,<br>
 cannot substitute for vaccines in protecting the population against the coronavirus <br>
 disease,” Saksela points out. <br>
 <br>

However, there is a great need for novel means with which to enhance the protection <br>
provided by vaccines.<br>
<br>
“Individuals whose immune system does not respond strongly enough to vaccines spring to<br>
 mind in particular. Having said that, we know that new variants, especially Omicron, <br>
 are capable of circumventing even effective vaccine responses worryingly well. Taken <br>
 before any kind of social interaction, TriSb92 could be useful to people whose vaccine<br>
 protection is insufficient for one reason or another. Depending on the epidemic situation,<br>
 it could also benefit fully vaccinated individuals when administered before any situation<br>
 associated with a high risk of exposure,” Saksela assesses.<br>
