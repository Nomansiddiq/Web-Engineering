        Life of a Programmer:
    </h3>
    <p>
        A programmer's day-to-day life is generally spent reading code, fixing errors, and writing new pieces of code. <br>
		Programming is a highly mentally demanding job as it requires constant problem-solving. In addition to these tasks, <br>
		there are also meetings with other programmers and stakeholders in the project.<br>

       Well, the life of a programmer is quite dense â€“ most programmers spend much of their time writing code using <br>
	   the computer language and thinking about how to solve problems such as testing and solving for bugs <br>
	   in the code or thinking of how to create a new feature.<br>
