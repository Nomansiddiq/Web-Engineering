            Life of A Gamer Developer:

    </h3>
    <p>
        The work life of a game developer is generally comfortable, so a little bit of overtime in short <br>
		bursts is pretty easy to swallow. But when it goes on for too long–for weeks or even for months–that's <br>
		when it starts to cause problems with the developers' health and personal life.<br>

    <p>
       Game developers typically work during regular business hours—so 40 hours a week. <br>
	   They may put in extra hours in the evenings and on weekends when a release deadline is nearing.<br>
